/** Wavefolder: folds the signal back on itself instead of clipping it,
 *  adding jagged, buzzy harmonics that get harsher as the amount
 *  increases. Built on top of DaisySP's Wavefolder: the signal is
 *  turned up, and every part of it that goes past -1 or 1 is folded
 *  back inside instead of being cut off. So the output never goes past
 *  -1 to 1, but a quiet input comes out louder, and needs more amount
 *  before it starts to fold.
 *  Usage:
 *      WaveFolder folder;
 *      folder.Init();
 *      folder.SetAmount(0.5f);
 *      float sample = folder.Process(input);
