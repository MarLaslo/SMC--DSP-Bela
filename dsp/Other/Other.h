/** Easy DSP library: include this one header to get every "other"
 *  utility that doesn't fit under synthesis or effects - envelopes,
 *  an LFO, sample and hold, a sequencer, polyphony (VoiceManager)
 *  and a limiter. Each one is a small class with the same shape:
 *
 *      Init(sample_rate)      - call once, in setup() (some don't
 *                                need a sample rate)
 *      SetXxx(...)            - set its parameters
 *      Process(...)           - call once per audio sample, returns it
