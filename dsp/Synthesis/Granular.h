/** Granular synthesis: wraps daisysp::GranularPlayer around a small,
 *  self-generated waveform so it works as a standalone synth voice,
 *  no sample recording/loading required. The buffer is filled once at
 *  Init() with a few cycles of a bandlimited sawtooth that tile it
 *  seamlessly; the granulator then reads overlapping, windowed grains
 *  out of that buffer to produce the sound.
 *  Pitch and grain-scan-speed are independent controls (that's the
 *  whole point of granular synthesis): SetFreq() shifts the pitch of
 *  the grains, SetSpeed() controls how fast the read position drifts
 *  through the buffer (0 = frozen on one spot, for a pure drone-like
 *  grain tone).
 *  An ADSR amp envelope shapes each note: NoteOn() opens it, NoteOff()
 *  releases it.
 *  Usage:
 *      Granular voice;
 *      voice.Init(sample_rate);
 *      voice.SetFreq(440.f);
 *      voice.SetGrainSize(40.f);
 *      voice.SetSpeed(0.1f);
 *      voice.NoteOn();
 *      float sample = voice.Process();
 *      ...
 *      voice.NoteOff();
